## Profile Customization
The profile is **100% configurable** in-game through the addon ***PQInterface***!

This addon saves your configurations ***even after you exit the game*** so you'll never have to re-do your configuration ever again once you've set it up to your personal liking. **PQInterface** also ships with 10 configurable ***Profiles*** so you can have multiple configuration sets at the click of a button!

You can download **PQInterface** from here:
